P:
write a method- Input: string as arguement Output: returns string with words longer than 4 letters reversed

words are defined as characters with no spaces
there should be no spaces in the output unless there is more than one word

Scan the string for words longer than 4 letters, reverse those words

E: 
puts reverse_words('Professional')          # => lanoisseforP
puts reverse_words('Walk around the block') # => Walk dnuora the kcolb
puts reverse_words('Launch School')         # => hcnuaL loohcS

D:
Array with each word as an element

A: 
convert the string into an array of words
iterate through the string, checking if words are longer than 4 characters.
  if so, reverse the word
Convert the array back to a string
