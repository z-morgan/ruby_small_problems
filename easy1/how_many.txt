P:
input array of strings
output: print the number of occurances of each element

elements must be absolutely unique, and case sensitive.
the number must be printed alongside the element

Given an array of elements, count the number of occurances of each element,
and display the number alongside the element

E: 
- the given example
- the given example, but with some case-changes to strings,
- change up the class of some elements

D: the program will build a hash to store the number of occurances of each element
A: 
create a new hash
iterate through the array, for each element:
  if the element is not in the hash, add it, and assign a value of 1
  if the element is in the hash, incriment its value by 1
display the hash

START
SET hash = an empty hash
FOREACH element in the array:
  IF element is not in hash, add element with value SET to 1
  IF element is already in hash, incriment value by 1
FOREACH element in the hash:
  PRINT the key and the value
